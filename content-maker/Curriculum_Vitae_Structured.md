## üìù Summary
I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for leveraging technology to improve communication and solve complex challenges. While pursuing my programming studies at 42 Berlin, I have honed my skills through hands-on projects, including building custom shells and tackling multi-threaded synchronization problems. My experience as an independent web developer has taught me to deliver solutions by aligning technical capabilities with user needs. I am proficient in C and enjoy collaborating with teams to create scalable, user-focused software. A native Spanish speaker, fluent in English, and with basic German proficiency, I bring a global perspective to my work. I am eager to contribute to impactful projects while growing my technical expertise and delivering high-quality, innovative solutions.
