# About 42 Berlin students

## Purpose
The first internship marks the culmination of the Core Curriculum, typically achieved after approximately 18 months of full-time study. This pivotal experience offers students the opportunity to apply and enhance their software engineering skills in a real-world setting. In addition to validating their technical expertise, it fosters the development of essential soft skills such as social competence and teamwork, while helping shape their future career paths.

## Competence Level
When 42 students start their internship, they have finished all required projects of the 42 Core Curriculum. At this point, they are qualified for Junior Developer positions.

### Programming
42 graduates possess strong software engineering skills that are adaptable across various programming languages. Throughout the core projects, students build a solid foundation in key areas, including:
- Imperative programming in C
- Object-Oriented programming in C++
- Data structures & algorithms
- Concurrent programming
- Network programming
- Networks and systems administration
- Graphics programming, web programming

### Ready-to-work
Thanks to our project-based, hands-on learning approach, 42 students require less onboarding and are able to deliver value quickly. Below are a few examples of projects our students tackled during their core curriculum at 42:
- A shell in C, implementing pipes, environment variables and many builtins
- A 3D Game, implementing either ray-casting or ray-tracing algorithms
- Virtualizing several Docker images, creating them in a new virtual machine
- A HTTP server in C++. One of the most used protocol on the internet
- Design, development, and organization of a full-stack web application

### Soft Skills
Due to the high level of community interaction fostered by the 42 peer-learning approach, our students develop strong soft skills and teamwork, along with a pragmatic, entrepreneurial, and self-directed mindset.

### High autonomy
The independent nature of our curriculum equips students to be self-starters, highly motivated, and adept at learning and delivering results through their own initiative.

### Ability to learn
Most importantly, our students excel at independent learning and quickly acquire new skills as needed. They are autonomous, detail-oriented, and deeply passionate about their work.
