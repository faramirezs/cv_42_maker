## Projects

**First project**: Creating content at scale and online presence for US lifestyle and existential coach Adam Lugsch-Tehle. Project duration: 3 months.

I built 2 full WordPress websites, one for personal brand and the second for the coaching program. 

We created a CRM with automations and email marketing, funnels, booking system, and email and SMS reminders.

Created a system to produce 52 long-format videos and more than 300 shorts for social media. 

I created and optimized several chained prompts. Based on an initial input from Adam, the system was able to create: video outline, video script, video description, and social media captions. 

For this, we integrated and automated Airtable + Integromat + ChatGPT's API.I used chained prompts and variables coming from our Airtable. Using Airtable allow me to push the input variables via webhooks and also receive the output from the system again.

For the **second project**, I developed a prompt deck aimed at constructing compelling story brands. 

Inspired by Donald Miller's insightful works, namely "Hero on a Mission: A Path to a Meaningful Life" and "Building a StoryBrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen" 

I was deeply moved by the transformative power of effective storytelling for entrepreneurs and brands.

I observed the challenges faced by businesses in maintaining a consistent narrative across various touchpoints, despite possessing remarkable stories. 

Recognizing the potential for more meaningful audience engagement through cohesive storytelling, 

I embarked on creating and testing a series of prompts, from the books and from other sources like "How to" guides.

These prompts serve as a guide for building a compelling story brand for any business.

My vision was to create a tailored storybrand knowledge, capable of being leveraged by AI to produce content that encapsulates the essence of each brand's message with precision, impact and meaning.

Attached is an example of a prompt in action. This particular prompt focuses on crafting a storybrand one-liner, a succinct statement that articulates what your business does and why it matters. 

Essentially, the one-liner serves as a concise elevator pitch, condensing your value proposition into 2-3 sentences for easy understanding and memorability.

**Third project**: JurisDATA, SEO blog with more than 25,000 monthly visits. I created this to offer a massive solution to a common problem in Colombia. We created JurisDATA to offer practical knowledge about different fines and penalties and how people can appeal against them. 

We started researching the keywords, competitors, and the gaps in between. And we created hundreds of blogs about the topic. 

We developed a lead magnet system that enabled us to extract fines data from official sources, facilitating targeted appeals strategies following different sets of rules, and we were able to identify possible ways of action in order to proceed with the appeals. 

We have more than 40,000 vehicle owners enlisted in our database thanks to this system. 

In terms of monetization, we offer a customized digital product targeting the specific problem we found. And since last year, we also had revenue from Google AdSense.


Just like any craftsman, I'm all about diving deep into perfecting my skills. Bring on the tough challenges and push me out of my comfort zone – that's where the real growth happens! 

Serving and sharing my talents and joining forces with a tribe of like-minded individuals to make it happen? Count me in!
