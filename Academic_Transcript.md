## Details of the Curriculum

Founded in 2013, 42 is a global network of ICT schools providing scalable, high-quality software engineering education. Our innovative model emphasizes peer-to-peer learning, project-based and hands-on programming, enabling students to become industry-ready within 2 to 5 years. The curriculum is divided into two parts: the Core Curriculum, after which students may either continue to the Advanced Curriculum or graduate as alumni.

### Skills developed during the entire Core Curriculum:

- **Algorithms & AI:** Classic algorithms, data structures, and asynchronous logic.
- **Graphics:** Image manipulation, drawing shapes, and event-driven programming.
- **Group & Interpersonal:** Teamwork, collaboration, and group dynamics.
- **Imperative Programming:** C programming, memory management, and data structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** C++ classes, inheritance, templates, and abstraction.
- **System Programming:** Unix system calls, file handling, and process control.
- **Network & Sysadmin:** Linux system setup, user management, and basic network services.
- **Web:** Full-stack web development, MVC, and UI/UX basics.
